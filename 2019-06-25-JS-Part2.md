# JavaScript

## Perform all operators

var a=1, b=2, c="0", d

```rb
console.log(a+b+c) //string
console.log(a+b-c) //number
console.log(a+b*c) //number
console.log(a+b/c) //number
console.log(a-b+c) //string
console.log(a-b-c) //number
console.log(a-b*c) //number
console.log(a-b/c) //number
console.log(a*b+c) //string
console.log(a*b-c) //number
console.log(a*b*c) //number
console.log(a*b/c) //number
console.log(a/b+c) //string
console.log(a/b-c) //number
console.log(a/b*c) //number
console.log(a/b/c) //number
```
## Print "20"

```rb
a += 1
console.log(a+c)
```

## === & ==

===: triple equal requires strict equality. It means both the type and value have the same

```rb
5 === 5     //true
11 === '11' //false
```

==: double equal just requires loose equality. It performs type coercion which compare two values after attempting to convert them into a common type.

```rb
11 == '11'
```

## console.log (0.1+0.2 === 0.3)

This will be false.
Because internally, computers use a format (binary floating-point) that cannot accurately represent a number like 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 at all.
For example, decimal numbers cannot accurately represent a number like 1/3. When the code is compiled or interpreted, it is already rounded to the nearest number in that format, which results in a small rounding error even before the calculation happens
